html and css for a tech blog
The files for this emerging technology were part of my final project for my web develpoment course at CGCC Spring 2021.
The project required only HTML and CSS files with working internal and external navigation.
The content was created for another technology course which required weekly articles on emerging technologies.
The original articles had several citations each, and my intent was to reproduce them entirely for the website.
Unfortunately, the website project is graded by a rubric with a very limited set of requirements. I also encountered a
lack of clarity regarding the conventions of citations in general. It is very clear how direct quotes are to be documented,
but the indirect citations were a little more difficult for me to find information about the conventions.
Therefore, I simplified the site by reducing the citations to direct quotes done with the <blockquote> tag and rewriting
my articles as informative opinion pieces.
Now that the assignment is complete, I am moving the project here for sharing and further development.
